{{<section title="First steps">}}
This is the first IMI Showtime for some of our group members. In general, we knew what was ahead of us to reach our shared goals. 
After **kicking off** the project and **getting to know each member's strengths and preferences**, as well as our supervisor's visions, we excitingly head on moved to the **brainstorm and research phase**. In this phase, we clarified questions, collected functional ideas from each member, talked about available techologies and initial visuals of the application. In addition, one of the core tasks was to conduct data research. Afterwards we had to **make decisions** about our chosen tech stack. We defined functional and non-functional requirements, as well as visions and goals. A low-fidility design had been prepared to visualise the ideas resulting from the brainstorm sessions. Tools such as Miro and the Gitlab board were of great help to manage the ideas and visuals. Finally, the last step of the overall preperation phase was to **accquire the necessary knowledge** and missing data to initiate the development.

<!-- Our **goal was clear**. We generally knew what we had to do to reach our goal.
Some **questions** still **came up**, that had to be answered first, before starting to code.
We had to first **decide on a framework** we want to use.
It was also important to know upfront whether our app is **offline or online**.
After answering all these questions, we **split up in two subgroups**. One group was **responsible for the backend** and how we would **retrieve the data**.
The other group was **responsible for the frontend** and how we **integrate the text recognition plugin**.
We were **always staying in contact** and **communicating with each other regularly**.
We **stayed** in these **subgroups** up until our **prototype was done**. -->

{{<section title="Sketches & Storyboard">}}
<!-- We knew a couple of things before thinking of our design. Our app would have three pages: A **search, camera and history screen**. We also liked the idea of **valuing a clean and simple design over a complex one** because it fits our app the best. -->

{{<section title="Mockup">}}
<!-- For our **prototype**, we wanted to make sure that our **basic structure** and **feature set** is **present**. Our **UI** wasn't the **main focus at that point**. After having our prototype, we also set out to **improve our UI** by making it **look more like our Mockup**. -->

{{<section title="Second phase">}}
<!-- Our second phase started with a **brainstorm**.
We thought about **possible features** and **sorted them by their priority**.
This process took some time because we came up with great ideas but filtering them to what was possible in our given time window wasn't easy.  
The **Miro board helped us** a lot in the process of visualising and managing our ideas.
We also used it as a Task/Kanban board.
We **never ran out of ideas**, therefore our idea collection and **prioritisation changed weekly**.
Staying in touch with our **supervisor helped us** a good deal with our decision making over which features to implement.
Keeping a **constant communication flow allowed** us to be **very flexible**.
This phase lasted until the end of our development. -->

{{<section title="Obstacles">}}
#### Frontend

#### Backend

#### Other


<!-- Our backend group struggled with retrieving data at first.
Since our **data came from the European Commission**, who was **fond of helping people** who were going to use the data, we knew that we wanted to **get in touch** with them to see if they had an **API endpoint** or something else to help us in any way.
It turns out they had one, but it was **poorly documented**.
We **didn't know** how to **access the data** we wanted.
After a lot of **confusion** and a couple of **mails exchanging**, we found out that the endpoint **didn't even provide a way to access the data** but only to return a file containing the data.
So it was a **dead-end** and cost us at least 1 1/2 weeks. -->

<!-- At around the same time, the other group struggled with their own problems.
One of their tasks was to **cut unnecessary words from our recognized text**, so we didn't have to search for them in our database hence improving our performance.
Their **idea** was to use **RegEx** but **no one** in our group **has used** RegEx before.
It was quite a **drag** for them to get into RegEx, especially because we had so many **little details to consider**.
This was an **ongoing process** up until the end because there was always **something to improve on**. -->
