#### Django/Python
When choosing the backend, we had decided to use Python in conjunction with Django. We had the choice to use NodeJS instead, but the final choice was Python in combination with Django. Django offers on the one hand the possibility to set up a SQLIte DB without downloading additional dependencies and on the other hand a fully integrated user-role management system. Furthermore, Django is an excellent tool to implement prototypical approaches. Because the project focus was on research, we were tempted to use utilities that would take some of the work off our hands. Django offers many templates due to the many plugins, which supported us in our development flow.     
Another reason was that we wanted to create synergies and not burden our tech stack unnecessarily. Since Python is predominantly used in state of the art machine learning models, it was logical for us to also embed Python as a backend. Even though we finally decided for a knowledge based system, Python was the best choice.

#### React/Typescript
We chose React for the frontend because it is very lightweight and allows controlled dom updates. Furthermore, it is very beginner-friendly compared to other frameworks such as Angular. The component-based design contributes to a clear structure. In addition, it is becoming apparent that React is gaining popularity in the international arena. In combination with Typescript, we had a very pleasant developer experience. Typescript helps to type variables and classes which allows you to detect errors faster and write consistent and clean code.


#### ThreeJS
We wanted to visualize playful elements in our app. However, we found that few technologies exist that fit our vision. ThreeJS

#### Gitlab/Git
We decided to use GitHub as our hosting platform for version control and figured out a **useful and collaborative workflow** after a while.

#### Miro
We used Miro as an altered form of an agile Kanban board for **visualizing our ideas, suggestions, and useful links**.
By using pins, we created a visual overview of the tasks that are currently worked on and prioritized each one to know what to do next

#### Discord/Zoom
**Discord** was mainly our **communication platform** for team meetings and quick interactions during the project semester. Additionally, we used **Zoom** for **meetings** with our **supervisor**.
